{"id":"TabzBeads-ng1","title":"Unified Conductor Workflow v2","description":"# Unified Conductor Workflow v2\n\nPhase 1 consolidation: merge bd-work, bd-swarm, bd-swarm-auto into unified commands with interactive prompts and guardrails.\n\nSee: docs/conductor-workflows.md section \"PROPOSED: Unified Interactive Architecture\" for full details.\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### 1. Two Commands (refine + work)\n\nReplace 4 entry points with 2 interactive commands:\n\n```\n/conductor:refine   →  Prepare issues (research phase, cheap Haiku via pmux)\n/conductor:work     →  Execute issues (implementation phase, Opus workers)\n```\n\n### 2. /conductor:work AskUserQuestion Flow\n\n```\n/conductor:work\n  Q1: \"Here are the unblocked issues:\" [multiSelect]\n      → Select 1 = single worker mode (no worktree)\n      → Select N = parallel workers mode (with worktrees)\n  \n  Q2: \"How should this run?\" [if N \u003e 1]\n      → Interactive = monitor, questions ok\n      → Autonomous = waves until backlog empty\n  \n  Q3: \"Worker count?\" [if interactive + many issues]\n      → 2, 3, 4, or \"All ready issues\"\n```\n\n### 3. /conductor:complete with Auto-Detection\n\nAdd guardrails to prevent workers from pushing/reviewing (conductor's job):\n\n```\n/conductor:complete \u003cissue-id\u003e\n  Step 0: AUTO-DETECT MODE\n    - CONDUCTOR_SESSION env var present → WORKER\n    - Inside git worktree → WORKER\n    - Otherwise → STANDALONE\n  \n  WORKER MODE:\n    verify → tests → commit → close → notify\n    ⚠️ DO NOT PUSH (conductor handles merge/review)\n  \n  STANDALONE MODE:\n    verify → tests → code-review → commit → close → push prompt\n```\n\nDetection logic:\n```bash\nis_worker_mode() {\n  [ -n \"$CONDUCTOR_SESSION\" ] \u0026\u0026 return 0  # Env var set by conductor\n  COMMON_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir 2\u003e/dev/null)\n  GIT_DIR=$(git rev-parse --git-dir 2\u003e/dev/null)\n  [ \"$COMMON_DIR\" != \"$GIT_DIR\" ] \u0026\u0026 return 0  # Inside worktree\n  return 1\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Deprecation Strategy\n\n- `bd-work` → alias to `/conductor:work` + deprecation notice\n- `bd-swarm` → alias to `/conductor:work` + deprecation notice  \n- `bd-swarm-auto` → removed (use work with \"Autonomous\" selection)\n\n## Blocked Issues\n\nThis epic blocks:\n- TabzBeads-y4c: Implement /conductor:work skill\n- TabzBeads-6jp: Implement /conductor:complete guardrails\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [x] Design unified /conductor:work flow\n- [x] Design auto-detection for worker vs standalone mode\n- [x] Define deprecation strategy for old commands\n- [ ] y4c implements /conductor:work\n- [ ] 6jp implements /conductor:complete with guardrails","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-09T17:24:04.927028779-05:00","created_by":"marci","updated_at":"2026-01-09T17:58:04.879881982-05:00","closed_at":"2026-01-09T17:58:04.879881982-05:00","close_reason":"Design complete.
